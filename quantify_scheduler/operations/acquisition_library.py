            to the setpoints of a schedule (e.g., tau in a T1 experiment).
        bin_mode :
            Describes what is done when data is written to a register that already
            contains a value. Options are "append" which appends the result to the
            list or "average" which stores the weighted average value of the
            new result and the old register value, by default BinMode.APPEND
        phase :
            The phase of the pulse and acquisition in degrees, by default 0
        t0 :
            The acquisition start time in seconds, by default 0
        data :
            The operation's dictionary, by default None
            Note: if the data parameter is not None all other parameters are
            overwritten using the contents of data.

        Creates a new instance of TriggerCount, trigger counting
        acquisition protocol, returning an integer.

        The trigger acquisition mode is used to measure how
        many times the trigger level is surpassed. The level is set
        in the hardware configuration.

        Parameters
        ----------
        port
            The acquisition port.
        clock
            The clock used to demodulate the acquisition.
        duration
            The acquisition duration in seconds.
        acq_channel
            The data channel in which the acquisition is stored, by default 0.
            Describes the "where" information of the measurement, which typically
            corresponds to a qubit idx.
        acq_index
            The data register in which the acquisition is stored, by default 0.
            Describes the "when" information of the measurement, used to label or

            to the setpoints of a schedule (e.g., tau in a T1 experiment).
