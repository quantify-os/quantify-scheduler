    The Trace acquisition protocol measures a signal s(t).

    Only processing performed is rescaling and adding
    units based on a calibrated scale. Values are returned
    as a raw trace (numpy array of float datatype). Length of
    this array depends on the sampling rate of the acquisition
    device.

    Parameters
    ----------
    port
        The acquisition port.
    clock
        The clock used to demodulate the acquisition.
    duration
        The acquisition duration in seconds.
    acq_channel
        The data channel in which the acquisition is stored, is by default 0.

        the incoming complex signal.
    weights_sampling_rate
        The rate with which the weights have been sampled, in Hz. By default equal

        the weights will be resampled with the sampling rate supported by the target
        hardware.
    interpolation

class TriggerCount(AcquisitionOperation):  # pylint: disable=too-many-ancestors
    """
    Trigger counting acquisition protocol returning an integer.

    The trigger acquisition mode is used to measure how
    many times the trigger level is surpassed. The level is set
    in the hardware configuration.

    Parameters
    ----------
    port
        The acquisition port.
    clock
        The clock used to demodulate the acquisition.
    duration
        The acquisition duration in seconds.
    acq_channel
        The data channel in which the acquisition is stored, by default 0.
        Describes the "where" information of the measurement, which typically
        corresponds to a qubit idx.
    acq_index
        The data register in which the acquisition is stored, by default 0.
        Describes the "when" information of the measurement, used to label or
        tag individual measurements in a large circuit. Typically corresponds
        to the setpoints of a schedule (e.g., tau in a T1 experiment).
    bin_mode
        Describes what is done when data is written to a register that already
        contains a value. Options are "append" which appends the result to the
        list or "average" which stores the count value of the
        new result and the old register value, by default BinMode.APPEND.
    t0
        The acquisition start time in seconds, by default 0.
