    The function generates a :class:`~Schedule` for a time trace experiment
    where single side band integration (i.e. ``SSBIntegrationComplex``) is
    applied repeatedly. Compared to the Trace schedule which returns one point
    each ns for 16.4 Î¼s (qblox instrument), the long time trace allows the
    user to customize the integration time and the number of data points in the trace (a minimum of
    300 ns (qblox instrument) for the integration time is needed in
    between two points). The resulting :class:`~Schedule` can be used for
    quantum experiments involving dynamic processes (charge transition) and
    time-dependent measurements (Elzerman Readout).

    Parameters
    ----------
    pulse_amp
        The amplitude of the pulse in Volt.
    frequency
        The frequency of the pulse and of the data acquisition in Hertz.
    acquisition_delay
        The start of the data acquisition with respect to the start of the pulse in
        seconds.
    integration_time
        Integration time per point in the trace. A minimum of 300ns is required du
        to the spacing of acquisition protocols in QbloxInstrument.
    port
        The location on the device where the
        pulse should be applied.
    clock
        The reference clock used to track the pulse frequency.
    num_points
        Number of points the output long_trace contains.
        The total time of the long_trace is then nb_pts*integration_time
    pulse_delay
        The pulse delay in seconds.
    acq_index
        The data register in which the acquisition is stored, by default 0.
        Describes the "when" information of the measurement, used to label or
        tag individual measurements in a large circuit. Typically corresponds
