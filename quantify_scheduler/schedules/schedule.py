    The :class:`~.ScheduleBase` is a data structure that is at
    the core of the Quantify-scheduler and describes when what operations are applied
    where.

    The :class:`~.ScheduleBase` is a collection of
    :class:`quantify_scheduler.operations.operation.Operation` objects and timing
    constraints that define relations between the operations.

    The schedule data structure is based on a dictionary.
    This dictionary contains:

    - operation_dict - a hash table containing the unique
        :class:`quantify_scheduler.operations.operation.Operation` s added to the
        schedule.
    - schedulables - a dictionary of all timing constraints added
        between operations.

    The :class:`~.Schedule` provides an API to create schedules.
    The :class:`~.CompiledSchedule` represents a schedule after
    it has been compiled for execution on a backend.


    The :class:`~.Schedule` contains information on the
    :attr:`~.ScheduleBase.operations` and
    :attr:`~.ScheduleBase.schedulables`.
    The :attr:`~.ScheduleBase.operations` is a dictionary of all
    unique operations used in the schedule and contain the information on *what*
    operation to apply *where*.
    The :attr:`~.ScheduleBase.schedulables` is a dictionary of
    Schedulables describing timing constraints between operations, i.e. when to apply
    an operation.
