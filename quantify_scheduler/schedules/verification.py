    Generates a staircase program in which the amplitude of a readout pulse is varied.

    Schedule sequence

    Parameters
    ----------
    readout_pulse_amps
        amplitudes of the square readout pulse in Volts.
    readout_pulse_duration
        duration of the spectroscopy pulse in seconds.
    readout_frequency
        readout_frequency of the spectroscopy pulse and of the data acquisition in
        Hertz.
    acquisition_delay
        start of the data acquisition with respect to the start of the spectroscopy
        pulse in seconds.
    integration_time
        integration time of the data acquisition in seconds.
    port
        location on the device where the pulse should be applied.
    clock
        reference clock used to track the readout frequency.
    batched
        schedule to be run in batched mode in the hardware backend.
    init_duration :
        The relaxation time or dead time.
    acq_channel
        The acquisition channel to use for the acquisitions.
    repetitions
        The amount of times the Schedule will be repeated.

    Notes
    -----
    This schedule can be used to verify the binning and averaging functionality of
    weighted acquisition for readout modules such as a Qblox QRM or a ZI UHFQA.

    Because of the overlap between the readout pulse and the integration window, the
    change in readout pulse amplitude should show up immediately in the acquired signal.
