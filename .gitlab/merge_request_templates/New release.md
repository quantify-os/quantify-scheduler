## Checklist for a new release

1. [ ] Review that `AUTHORS.md` has been updated.

1. Update `CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/tutorials/qblox/recent.md` and `README.md`:
    - [ ] Update `Unreleased` chapter title in `CHANGELOG.md` to `X.Y.Z (YYYY-MM-DD)`.
      - Also update `Unreleased` title in `docs/source/reference/qblox/recent.md` (if present).
    - [ ] Order changelog alphabetically based on the key (secondary order of entries with same key can be kept as is): Key - Description
    - [ ] Add compatibility info, extract the versions from `pyproject.toml` and https://pypi.org/project/qblox-instruments/ (Qblox Cluster firmware):
      ```
      ### Compatibility info

      - Qblox: `qblox-instruments==x.x.x` (Cluster firmware vx.x.x)
      - ZI:    `zhinst==x.x.x` `zhinst-qcodes==x.x.x` `zhinst-toolkit==x.x.x`
      ```
    - [ ] Update `## Hardware/driver compatibility` in `README.md`.

1. [ ] Review `@deprecated` and `FutureWarning`s that can be cleaned up now.

1. CI pipeline:
    - [ ] Automated pipeline passes.
    - [ ] All `Test (py3.x, Windows, manual)` pass (trigger manually!).

1. [ ] Commit pip frozen requirements for future reference:
    - Go to the `Test (py3.9, Linux)` pipeline job and download the `artifacts` (right side "Job artifacts" `-->` "Download").
    - Unzip, get the `frozen-requirements.txt`.
    - Paste it in `frozen_requirements` directory.
    - Rename it, commit & push:

      ```bash
      NEW_VERSION=X.Y.Z
      echo $NEW_VERSION

      mv frozen_requirements/frozen-requirements.txt frozen_requirements/frozen-requirements-$NEW_VERSION.txt

      git add frozen_requirements/frozen-requirements-$NEW_VERSION.txt
      git commit -m "Add pip frozen requirements for $NEW_VERSION"
      git push
      ```

1. [ ] Create tag for bumped version:
    - Merge this MR into `main`.
    - Switch to `main` branch.
    - Create and push an **annotated** tag `vX.Y.Z` pointing to the merge commit:

      ```bash
      echo $NEW_VERSION

      git tag -a "v${NEW_VERSION}"  # Note: should be vX.Y.Z, not X.Y.Z
      # You will be prompted for a tag description: `Release vX.Y.Z`
      git push origin "v${NEW_VERSION}"
      ```
    <!-- - Future TODO: finish automation of this step in `.gitlab-ci.yml`. -->
    <!-- 1. [ ] Run **one** of the major/minor/patch version bump (manual) jobs in the CI pipeline of the MR. -->
    <!--     - NB this can only be done after unix and windows test & docs jobs pass. -->


1. [ ] Add `Unreleased` chapter back to `CHANGELOG.md`. Commit and push it to `main` directly (no need to review it). Commit message: `Start development of vX.Y.Z+1`.

1. [ ] **Create** and **push** (see steps above) an **annotated** tag `vX.Y.Z+1.dev` pointing to the commit above.  Commit annotation: `Start development of vX.Y.Z+1`.
    <!-- Note: if we are following semver, this should be rather vX.Y+1.0.dev, and bugfixes need to go into a separate bugfix branch for each minor release a-la `stable/vX.Y`.
    Since we are not so strict with that and releasing minor and bugfix from the same branch, to avoid situation of having previous commit having version v0.7.0.dev19+abcdef and
    next commit version v0.6.5 (which is less than v0.7.0.devN, which should not be the case) we must bump a bugfix version (the most minor version we bump in main)
    and later we may decide that we are releasing a minor instad of a bugfix.-->

1. [ ] Create new release vX.Y.Z on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/quantify-os/quantify-scheduler/-/releases).
    - Copy/paste the changelog of the release

1. [ ] Manually edit the redirects from `/docs/quantify-scheduler` to `/docs/quantify-scheduler/vX.Y.Z/` and similar over at https://gitlab.com/quantify-os/quantify-os.gitlab.io/-/blob/main/source/extra/_redirects.

1. When `Release to test.pypi.org` job of the tag pipeline succeeds:
    - [ ] Install package in (test) env and validate (e.g., run a quick notebook).
       ```bash
       pip install quantify-scheduler==x.x.x --extra-index-url=https://test.pypi.org/simple/
       ```
       - _(For creating test env)_
         ```bash
         ENV_NAME=qtest # Adjust
         PY_VER=3.8
         DISPLAY_NAME="Python $PY_VER Quantify Test Env" && echo $DISPLAY_NAME # Adjust

         conda create --name $ENV_NAME python=$PY_VER
         conda activate $ENV_NAME
         conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
         python -m ipykernel install --user --name=$ENV_NAME --display-name="$DISPLAY_NAME"
         ```

1. [ ] Release on PyPi by triggering manual `Release to pypi.org` job and wait till it succeeds.
1. [ ] Post the new release in Slack (`#software-for-users` and `#software-for-developers`).
    - PS Rockets are a must! ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€
1. [ ] Inform the Quantify Marketing Team.
